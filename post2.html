          <p>C is a mid level proramming Language while is C++ is a high level programming Language.Programming languages that use common words and are relatively easy for most folks to read and study are called high level languages.The opposite ofthose are low-level languages, which are not easy to read or study.Low level languages run faster than High level languages and the size of the programms are much smaller
            C was developed at AT&T Bell Labs in the early 1970-72s.C is the offspring of both the B programming language and a language named BCPL, which stood for Basic Combined Programming Language. Most of the operating systems like Linux, Windows™, and Mac™ are either developed in C language or use of this language for most parts of the operating system and the tools coming with it. C is a programming language used to write a program. Programs are the set of instructions given by a programmer to the computer in high level language. C uses a compiler to translate the high level program into machine code before executing any
            instructions.  <br> <img src="/img/c lang.jpg" alt="html" width="300" height="250"> 
          </p>
         <p style="color:red">Image of a C language showing Hello world</p>

          <p>Compiler is a computer program that reads a program written in one language,which is called the source language, and translates it in to another language, which is
            called the target language. Most often, the source language is a high level language and
            the target language is a low level language. So, in general compilers can be seen as
            translators that translate from one language to another.   <br> <img src="/img/compiler.jpg" alt="html" width="300" height="250"> </p>

            <p>C++ is a statically typed, compiled, general-purpose, case-sensitive, free-form
              programming language that supports procedural, object-oriented, and generic
              programming.C++ is a superset of C, and that virtually any legal C program is a legal C++
              program. C++ fully supports object-oriented programming which includes Encapsulation,Data hiding,Inheritance,Polymorphism.The ANSI standard is an attempt to ensure that C++ is portable; that code you
              write for Microsoft's compiler will compile without errors, using a compiler on a
              Mac, UNIX, a Windows box, or an Alpha.Anyone who has used either an Apple Macintosh or a PC running Windows has
              indirectly used C++ because the primary user interfaces of these systems are
              written in C++.  <br> <img src="/img/c+.jpg" alt="html" width="300" height="250"></p>

              <p>Assembly language is the oldest programming language, and of all languages, bears the
                closest resemblance to native machine language. It provides direct access to computer hardware,
                requiring you to understand much about your computer’s architecture and operating
                system.An assembler is a utility program that converts source
                code programs from assembly language into machine language. A linker is a utility program that combines
                individual files created by an assembler into a single executable program. A related utility, called a
                debugger, lets you to step through a program while it’s running and examine registers and memory. <br> <img src="/img/Assembly.jpg" alt="html" width="300" height="300"></p>

                <p>Assembly language consists of statements written with
                  short mnemonics such as ADD, MOV, SUB, and CALL. Assembly language has a one-to-one relationship
                  with machine language: Each assembly language instruction corresponds to a
                  single machine-language instruction.</p>
