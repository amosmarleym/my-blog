          <p>HTML,CSS and Javascript along with its frameworks and libraies are the core foundation of every web page hosted on the internet.HTML means Hyper text mark up language, it is not a programming language but a mark up language useful for structring details or information on a webpage. the latest of version of HTML is HTML5 which has many added and improved fuctions absent in HTML4.</p>it is a welcome enhancement that
            increases the flexibility and usefulness of HTML. It also solves some problems; for instance, it can dispense with plugins for embedded video and audio clips, and the number of video file formats is  drastically reduced.HTML5 has brought agreement between the browser vendors because they participated in its formulation. This means that the way they handle coding errors is now standardized; all those little differences are ironed out. A browser’s parsing rules as specified by HTML5 ensure that all existing websites continue to function as before. <br> <br> <img src="/img/html.jpg" alt="html" 
            width="300" height="250"> 
            .</p>
            <p style="color:red">image showing Html header</p>
          <p>CSS means cascading style sheets. CSS is used for styling, designing, adding colours, changing text fonts, adding background colors and image, styling text buttons e.t.c.The latest version of CSS is CSS3.The advanced properties in CSS3 allow for more fanciful styling of your website, such as adding transitions and animations.There are three ways to apply CSS code to your site.The first is by linking to an external file. This is the recommended method. To do linking, you need to write your CSS rules in a separate text file and save it
            with a .css extension.</p> The syntax for adding the rules to your HTML code is link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css" You add the link tag to the head element, between the head.../head. tags. The first two attributes rel and type tell the browser that this is a CSS stylesheet. The first thing to learn about CSS is its syntax,which is relatively straightforward. The syntax is:selector { property : value; property : value; property : value; }. All elements in CSS are treated as boxes. CSS boxes consist of margins, borders,padding.<br><br><img src="/img/css.png" alt="html" 
            width="300" height="250" align="left"> 
          </p>
          
          <br>

          <p>JavaScript brings a dynamic functionality to your websites. Every time you see something pop up when you mouse over an item in the browser, or see new text, colors, orimages appear on the page in front of your eyes, or grab an object on the page and
            drag it to a new location—all those things are done through JavaScript. It offers effects that are not otherwise possible, because it runs inside the browser and has
            direct access to all the elements in a web document.<p> JavaScript is a client-side scripting language that runs entirely inside the web browser. To call it up, you place it between opening script and closing /script HTML tagsJavaScript is a powerful programming language with many frameworks and libraies, Javscript makes webpages dynamic, it controls how the website or webpage interacts with users some which are used in implementing frontend and backend fuctions of websites.</p> A JavaScript framework is a collection of JavaScript code libraies, it offers reusable code components, a universal development environment, compilers e.t.c In addition to writing JavaScript code directly in HTML documents, you can include files of JavaScript code either from your website or from anywhere on the internet.The syntax for this is as follows:
            script type="text/javascript" src="script.js">/script.
            <br> <br> <img src="/img/javascript.jpg" alt="javascript"  width="400" height="300" align="left"></p>
